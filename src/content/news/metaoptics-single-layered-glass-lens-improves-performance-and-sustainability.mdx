  [SINGAPORE] Local semiconductor optics startup MetaOptics Technologies is harnessing nanophotonics and artificial intelligence (AI) to overhaul traditional lens systems used in consumer electronics, augmented and virtual reality and scientific imaging.

<div>
  Its flagship innovation, the Advanced Color Metalens Imaging System, replaces multi-layer plastic lenses with a single-layer glass metalens.

  Using deep ultraviolet (DUV) immersion photolithography on 12-inch glass wafers – a standard process from semiconductor manufacturing – the system dramatically reduces the thickness and weight of camera modules, while offering enhanced durability and colour accuracy.

  The cameras in today's smartphones and point-and-shoot devices typically rely on stacked layers of plastic or glass lenses to focus light.

  Metalenses are flat optical components that can perform the same function using just a single layer of intricately patterned nanostructures.

  MetaOptics uses semiconductor fabrication techniques to etch millions of microscopic pillars – each about 1/800th the width of a human hair – onto glass wafers. A 1.5 mm lens can contain more than six million of these nano-pillars, precisely engineered to manipulate light and focus images.
