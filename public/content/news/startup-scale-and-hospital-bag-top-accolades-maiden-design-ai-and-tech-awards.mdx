    MetaOptics swept the judges with its <a className="mdx-link" href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/events-awards/design-ai-tech-awards/design-ai-and-tech-awards/metaoptics-single-layered-glass-lens-improves-performance-and-sustainability" target="_blank">advanced colour metalens imaging system</a> that features a single-glass layer alternative to traditional multi-layer curved plastic lenses.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
    Its deputy chief executive officer Aloysius Chua said in his presentation: "The challenge today with traditional three-dimensional optics is the bulkiness, complexity and high costs."
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
    He explained that metalenses, also known as flat optics or 2D lenses, are single layers of glass made up of millions of circular pillars of varying diameters – each as thin as one-thousandth of a human hair – at the same height.

  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
    "MetaOptics is the first company to produce a single-layer metalens on a 12-inch glass wafer, working in visible light wavelengths and integrated into a camera to capture a colour image," said Chua.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
    The startup boasts proprietary AI software that sharpens and improves the vibrancy of the images captured, as well as a brightening algorithm that lights up dark areas without overexposing brighter sections.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
    Noting that the lenses are fabricated and assembled in Singapore, Chua told BT: "We want Singapore to be the excellence centre of metalenses. We want to control the design and we want the key manufacturing supply chain to be in Singapore."

  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
    On winning the award, he said: "As a young startup, it brings validation to the work that we put in… In three-and-a-half years, we were able to develop tech and commercialise it, and now our products are already sold into the market."
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
    A mechanical engineer by training, Chua added: "We are not very far from commercialising lenses into the consumer electronics market… In the next few months, you will hear a lot about us."
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
    MetaOptics was one of the three winners among eight shortlisted projects.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
    Local robotics company LionsBot took the crown with its <a className="mdx-link" href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/events-awards/design-ai-tech-awards/design-ai-and-tech-awards/ai-boosts-efficiency-lionsbot-robot-cleaners" target="_blank">autonomous robots that are armed</a> with AI navigation, fleet management and generative AI support; and which use 10 per cent of the water utilised by traditional cleaning machines.

  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
    Design head Tan Wei Hua told BT: "It's the first award that really brings together design and technology… and a lot resonated with us, like how we're using design to make technology more accessible, impactful and delightful for users. It's an affirmation that we're on the right path of bringing design, AI and tech together."
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
    Founded in 2018, the mature startup has conducted some 10 cycles of prototyping of its robots, more than 3,500 of which are deployed in over 30 countries.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
    "We are not stopping here. In the next couple of years, we're aiming to double the number of robots that we're deploying worldwide," said LionsBot's Tan.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
    He concluded: "We have transformed cleaners into skilled robot operators, enhanced the dignity of the profession, improved accessibility to technology for the elderly and less-tech-literate and, at the same time, put Singapore on the map as a source of innovative design and engineering."
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
    Rounding up the three winners is Sengkang General Hospital (SKH) with its <a className="mdx-link" href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/events-awards/design-ai-tech-awards/design-ai-and-tech-awards/sengkang-general-hospital-leads-way-automating-sterile-supply-management" target="_blank">fully automated sterile supply system</a>.

  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
    Moarie Grace Tan, assistant director, nursing, operating theatre services, explained: "We have 14,000 unique instruments categorised into 4,000 products, 2,600 different kinds of surgeries and many surgeons with their own preferences, (which) becomes a huge nightmare when we can't find what is needed."
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
    With its first-of-its-kind automated storage and retrieval system in Singapore's healthcare sector, the hospital has halved retrieval times of instruments, boosted storage capacity by 75 per cent and reduced the manual handling of heavy containers.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
    "Now we can look into having the whole department as automated as possible," said SKH's Tan. "The award gives us that leverage because it tells others that we are people who are looking at innovating and making things work better, rather than just sticking to traditional methods."

    In a speech at the event, SUTD's deputy president and chief innovation and enterprise officer Tai Lee Siang said: "All the contestants put in clear indicators of the impact… some of which are not possible without the power of AI, to overcome past inefficiencies and accurately measure impact."
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
    Award submissions were assessed across six criteria: design-thinking process and strategies; originality; utilisation of AI and advanced technologies; ethical consideration and sustainability; aesthetic and functional qualities; and quantitative and qualitative impact.
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
    The six touchstones are weighted equally so that contenders use the opportunity to address a range of factors, said Prof Tai in an <a className="mdx-link" href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/events-awards/design-ai-tech-awards/where-ai-meets-design-leveraging-unfamiliar-business-differentiator" target="_blank">earlier interview</a> with BT.

    On why SUTD made the pivot to AI, the university's president Phoon Kok Kwang said: "We are making the bet that AI is not hype. If we are right, the opportunities for innovation would be staggering, and we want to be the forerunner of this post-AI world."
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-text">
    BT's Chen said: "This competition isn't just about ideas. It's about human-centric solutions amplified by AI's transformative potential… The best solutions don't just leverage AI; they elevate people and improve lives and processes."
